26/08/21

 A Date class that provides dates from 01/01/-4713 to 31/12/9999. 
 
 Operations on dates between 01/01/1900 and to 31/12/2149 use lookup tables and are most efficient.
 This class can deal with the Microsoft PC EXCEL leap year issue, that is, that the year 1900 is supposed (incorrectly) to be a leap year. 
 Support for positive Julian numbers is also provided.
